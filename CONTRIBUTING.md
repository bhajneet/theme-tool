## Getting Started

If you wish to better understand how `theme-tool` works or want to debug an issue: get the source, build it, and run it locally.

### Prerequisites

In order to download necessary tools, clone the repository, and install dependencies, you'll need network access.

You'll need the following:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org) (If you need to manage multiple Node.JS versions, [use a node version manager](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) to install)

Get the source code of `theme-tool` repo:

```shell
gh repo fork shabados/theme-tool --clone=true
```

**PROTIP**: Use the [`gh` cli tool from GitHub](https://cli.github.com/) to fork the repo to your GitHub account (if not already), clone it to your local machine, and set the appropriate remotes for origin and upstream with the above command.

### Build

Run `npm i` in the root directory.

### Start

```shell
npm start
```

This will launch Theme Tool on [port `3000`](https://localhost:3000).

## Workflow

The workflow of development (or Git Flow) is to [choose/create an issue](https://github.com/shabados/theme-tool/issues) to work on, [create a feature branch](https://github.com/shabados/.github/wiki/How-to-Contribute#branches), and [submit a pull request](https://github.com/shabados/.github/wiki/How-to-Contribute#pull-requests).

**PROTIP**: Read more about our workflow (issue tracking, branching, and pull requests) in the [How To Contribute wiki article](https://github.com/shabados/.github/wiki/How-to-Contribute).
